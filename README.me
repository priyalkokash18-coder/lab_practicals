DSPD LAB PRTICALS

1A. Write a program to accept a set of numbers in an array and calculate the sum of elements at odd and even positions separately.

1B. Write a program to implement Binary Search using a function to find a given element in a sorted array and return its position or NULL if not found.

1C. Create a program that defines a student structure with attributes like name, roll number, and marks, and sort the records using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

2. Implement a menu-driven program in C to perform Stack operations (Push, Pop, Display) using arrays and handle overflow and underflow conditions.

3. Implement a menu-driven program in C to perform Queue operations (Insert, Delete, Display) using arrays and handle overflow and underflow conditions.

4. Write a program to create a linked list, store elements entered by the user, display all elements, count the number of nodes, and stop when a NULL pointer is reached.

5. Write a program to create a linked list, insert nodes, and display the list with traversal operations such as insertion and deletion.

6. Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) with menu-driven options to insert, delete, and search elements, and display the tree traversals.

7. Write a program to represent a graph using an adjacency list and perform Depth First Search (DFS) traversal.

8. Implement Kruskal’s Algorithm in C to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, weighted graph.

9. Implement Hashing using a seven-slot closed hash table and handle collisions using a hash function (K mod 7).

10. Write a program to read data from one file and copy it into another file using file handling functions and generate a formatted output report in another file.
